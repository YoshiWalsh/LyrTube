## LyrTube

LyrTube is one of my old projects, I made it in 2013 just after graduating from high school. I was making timestamped lyrics at the time and wanted to show them to friends, but my friends didn't have music players that supported them. So I made LyrTube as a way to share timestamped lyrics with anyone.

Initially this project was written in PHP with a MySQL database and I had dreams of making a social network for lyrics. Basically genius.com but with timestamped lyrics. I've given up on those dreams but I'm still proud of this project, so I've converted everything to work statically so that it's easy to host.

As this is an old project, the code doesn't live up to my current standards. Please don't judge me for it.

You can see this project running live at [lyrtube.yoshiwalsh.me](https://lyrtube.yoshiwalsh.me/).
