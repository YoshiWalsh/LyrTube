[00:14.16]All of your wind has gone
[00:17.94]And all of the paths you've drawn
[00:21.90]Have sunk to the ocean sand,
[00:25.48]Where no one can see you stand
[00:29.28]And under the dark embrace,
[00:33.06]Cower the dreams you chase,
[00:36.96]Under the rust, and blood,
[00:40.65]Don't let yourself,
[00:44.92]Give up
[01:18.81]And all these steps,
[01:21.65]These steps that we take,
[01:23.67]Are leading us far away,
[01:27.45]And all these years,
[01:29.48]Passing each day
[01:31.18]Since then we are far away
[01:34.87]From where we were
[01:36.49]We did what we could,
[01:38.42]We're now years away,
[01:40.45]from where we stood,
[01:42.51]The road goes on,
[01:44.27]Far from it all.
