[00:34.68]In the beginning,
[00:36.53]we all start as a tiny seed,
[00:39.58]then a tender sprout
[00:41.47] 
[00:41.72]With water, light and the hope of love,
[00:45.12]We grow up toward the skies above

[01:31.85]The streets of our towns like garden rows
[01:35.54]That reach so high in the cities glowed
[01:38.87]With climbing vines and tendrils strong
[01:42.54]The sun comes up and the sun goes down
