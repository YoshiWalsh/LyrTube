[00:09.69]I never thought I'd resort to using a computer
[00:12.46]To try and find love, 'cause that stuff's just for losers.
[00:14.99]But there must be others like me who simply work a lot
[00:17.46]And are too busy to meet people, so I guess it's worth a shot.
[00:19.95][00:25.49][00:30.31][00:35.10][00:40.40][00:48.11][00:50.77][00:50.78][00:59.09][01:00.60][01:09.11][01:10.76][01:10.84][01:10.95][01:20.80][01:26.07][01:31.00][01:41.09][01:50.96][01:51.00][01:51.05][01:59.70][02:01.24][02:09.83][02:11.52][02:11.58][02:11.66][02:21.57][02:31.63][02:41.67][02:51.71][02:51.80][02:51.89][03:00.27][03:01.82][03:10.46][03:20.70][03:22.50][03:22.80][03:23.20][03:31.50][04:12.77]
[00:20.00]Okay, let's pick a username, something amusing,
[00:22.56]That conveys my sense of humor
[00:23.89]And is guaranteed to woo the babes.
[00:25.59]Hmm, everything I choose is lame,
[00:27.64]I'll use my first name and birthday,
[00:29.06]I bet no one else would do the same.
[00:30.73]Now it's time to find a profile pic,
[00:32.29]Something tasty,
[00:33.43]That the ladies,
[00:33.97]Won't be able to resist.
[00:35.22]I'll take one from Facebook,
[00:36.68]Nah actually, wait.
[00:38.17]Unconscious with a knob on my face,
[00:39.29]Isn't a great look.
[00:40.54]Finally I fill out my profile creatively;
[00:42.96]"How often do you drink?"
[00:44.34]Uh, occasionally.
[00:45.64]"Do you smoke?"
[00:46.49]*cough cough* Yeah but not regularly though...
[00:48.13]A few more tweaks, hit save,
[00:49.59]And I'm ready to go!
[00:50.80][01:00.77][01:51.11][02:01.55][02:51.98][03:02.24]When did finding someone become such a hard chore?
[00:53.23][01:03.35][01:53.97][02:04.14][02:54.70][03:04.75]I've had enough of bar crawls and dance floors,
[00:55.48][01:05.59][01:56.07][02:06.35][02:56.69][03:06.75]All I'm after is a partner who can make me cry with laughter,
[00:57.96][01:08.03][01:58.47][02:08.75][02:59.21][03:09.33]And who looks like Mrs. Carter.
[00:59.20][01:09.63][02:00.00][02:10.24][03:00.74][03:21.02]Is that too much to ask for?
[01:11.23]Now I'm browsing through profiles to take a peek
[01:13.33]And the results are underwhelming to say the least.
[01:15.95]I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,
[01:18.14]But if these are their best photos,
[01:19.39]Then how bad are the others?
[01:20.88]I pick a few that look promising, or at first it seems,
[01:23.57]But as a read on I notice some reoccurring themes;
[01:26.10]A lot of similar pictures and words o' advice
[01:28.18]So as I dig deeper I start reading between the lines:
[01:31.02]If she says that she's bubbly, don't be fooled or misled,
[01:33.87]'cause that's code for "not the sharpest tool in the shed."
[01:36.24]And if she says that she's curvy, that generally means,
[01:38.65]That when she sees vending machines, she empties 'em clean.
[01:41.37]And with their photos I also noticed a couple things:
[01:43.74]Camera angles designed to hide their double chins.
[01:46.36]I know that the camera never tells lies,
[01:48.25]But I beg to differ if they're ever held high.
[02:11.74]I get a notification and for a moment
[02:14.36]I'm filled with hope and elation,
[02:15.58]'cause this could be the most important message I'm ever about to view.
[02:18.76]I take a deep breath and open it:
[02:20.24]"Hey, hun, how are you?"
[02:21.75]I send out a few, but get no responses back,
[02:24.19]I'm 'bout to jack it in when someone new wants to chat.
[02:26.74]She's into movies, music, and cookery, too.
[02:29.21]But she's a looker to boot.
[02:30.68]This is too good to be true!
[02:31.74]Over the coming weeks we correspond regularly.
[02:34.05]I can't believe it, it feels like it was meant to be.
[02:36.68]Eventually we agree to meet in person,
[02:39.18]It's the first time in ages I've actually felt nervous!
[02:42.10]I'd love to tell you that the story ended happily.
[02:44.35]But that rarely ever happens in reality.
[02:46.87]Let's just say the pictures she had provided
[02:49.16]Made her liable in court for false advertisin'.
[03:10.80]And is just as good a dancer
[03:12.14]And is equally at home with a glass of Carver or lager.
[03:14.53]Is smart enough to graduate from Harvard with a Master's.
[03:17.13]Who isn't into drama, with breasts like Dolly Parton
[03:19.59]And preferably a rich father.
[03:23.52]Well, is it?
[03:25.96]I don't think so.
[03:27.96]I mean, all that stuff's just standard, right?
[03:31.85]Okay, okay, maybe she doesn't have to be a dancer.
[03:34.53]But everythin' else is essential.
[03:37.15]I mean, okay.
[03:38.54]She doesn't have to have an actual Master's degree from Harvard.
[03:41.46]But she's gotta be smart.
[03:43.01]And, you know, the rich dad thing?
[03:45.60]Pff, I guess I could take or leave.
[03:48.19]But everythin' else is strictly non-negotiable.
[03:50.83]Apart from the lager and Carver thing.
[03:53.69]And the Beyoncï¿½ thing.
[03:55.37]Obviously.
[03:57.03]But anything else is a deal breaker, I mean, what's even left after that, you know?
[04:02.34]But I'm not tryin' to be a dick, but
[04:04.85]I've just got high standards and I know what I'm lookin' for, you know?
[04:08.51]Yeah, yeah.
[04:11.06]Funny and boobs, yeah.
